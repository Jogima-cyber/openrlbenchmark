# Open RL Benchmark: Comprehensive Tracked Experiments for Reinforcement Learning

Open RL Benchmark is a comprehensive collection of tracked experiments for RL. It aims to make it easier for RL practioners to pull and compare all kinds of metrics from reputable RL libraries like Stable-baselines3, Tianshou, CleanRL, and others.

## Get started

Check out the [Open RL Benchmark reports](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/openrlbenchmark/reportlist): featuring W&B reports with tracked Atari, MuJoCo experiments from SB3, CleanRL, and others.

You can "fork" these reports and use them in your own workspace. See the following video for a demo
